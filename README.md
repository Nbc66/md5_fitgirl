# FitGirl MD5 Hash Checker

This is a simple md5 hash checker i made in python for fitgirls md5 file

i wrote this for fun since i dont like QuickSFV UI that much

# How To Use

this app supports specifying the md5 file provided by fitgirl repacks

you can specify a path to the folder like for example:

 - a direct path to the `.md5` file

 - specify a path to the repack folder
